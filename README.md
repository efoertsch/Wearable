# Wearable 

A coding exercise for a wear 2.0 patient vitals app. 

Display a list of patients and their vitals - blood pressure and pulse. Display an alert if a patients vitals go outside a present limit.

For this project, the list displayed is from static data. In the real world this info would come from a server on approximately 1 minute intervals. If a patients vitals go outside some preset limits send an alert to the wearable device. In the real world the server would connect to Firebase to send the alert to the watch. In this project, the alert is sent directly from Firebase.
